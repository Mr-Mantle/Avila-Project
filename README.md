# Avila-Project
+ For project summary and Q&A, please refer to: [summary](Avila-project-summery/)
+ In this research, we propose a new neural network deep learning framework based on the well-known SENet model, then apply this model to the Avila dataset, for more details, please see: [Unsupervised feature learning for data classification](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1994/1/012010)
+ the framework I created (based on Pytorch) for this project could be used independently to test our model proposed in the paper. The instructions and comments are included in the file. To access it, please download: [Avila-code](code/Main_program/)
